                              Welcome to Logitech Media Server 
   
This document describes the steps for installing the Logitech Media Server on Unix-like platforms.

Version 5.10.0 or higher of Perl is required.

Additional information can be found on the Wiki at: http://wiki.slimdevices.com/

Generic Notes:

You might be prompted to the Bin/build-perl-modules.pl script on your platform.

If any of the required binary modules fails to load on your system, The script
will download the modules, and build them for your OS. In order for the
build-perl-modules script to run successfully, you must have You must have:

- C Compiler - gcc, or your platforms system compiler (ANSI, not K&R)

- make

- Perl 5.10.0 or greater, and the required development libs (if any; some
  platforms put this in a separate package, such as 'libperl-dev')

- For XML::Parser to build properly - http://expat.sourceforge.net/
  This might also be a package on your system, such as expat-dev, libexpat-dev, etc.

FreeBSD Notes:

	In a normal installation of FreeBSD the version of Perl is 5.00 and not 
	sufficient for use with the Logitech Media Server software, which requires 5.10.0 or greater.

	To upgrade Perl to 5.10:

	First become the superuser, then issue the following commands

	# cd /usr/ports/lang/perl5.10
	# make install clean
	# rehash
	# use.perl port

	The Linux standard installation creates a user, slimserver, that owns
	all the appropriate files and is the login account for the 
	Logitech Media Server daemon. There is no requirement that the server daemon
	execute with extensive priviledges. As always, executing the perl programs
	as "root" is not good security practice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tarball Notes:

	If you aren't installing the RPM, you can start the server from a command line 
	with the following command:

	   ./slimserver.pl --daemon
	   
	This will start up the server and run itself in the background.

	Visit the URL that's printed out with your web browser to configure your 
	Logitech Media Server and see the complete documentation.

	As part of the debugging support, if there is no /etc/slimserver.conf file, or
	if it is not readable when the Logitech Media Server starts, it will look for ~/.slimserver.conf
	that is, the normally hidden file .slimserver.conf in the home directory of 
	the current user.

	If the server dies without any visible error messages, check the log file.
	For more verbose messages, start the program with the options of --d_server

	To refresh the configuration parameters, you can simply delete the /etc/slimserver.conf
	file (or rename it to something else). This will cause the Logitech Media Server to
	search for the ~/.slimserver.conf, and failing that, to recreate it with default values.
