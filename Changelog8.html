	<li>Server Changes:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/367">PR #367</a> - Improved parsing of HTTP header allows for new features (eg. AAC transcoding) and fixes some issues with streaming remote files. Thanks a lot philippe_44!</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/305">PR #305</a> - use ORIGINALYEAR in FLAC files to override YEAR (thanks jcbodnar!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/267">PR #267</a> - HTTPS certificates are now validated when LMS acts as a client.  HTTPS connections to plugin repositories are no-longer retried over HTTP when they fail.  The old insecure behaviour can optionally be re-enabled, although, instead, we recommend working out why HTTPS is broken in your environment and fixing that if possible.</li>
