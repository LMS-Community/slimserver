<ul>
	<li><a href="Changelog8.html#v8.1.2">Upstream fixes from Logitech Media Server 8.1.x</a></li>
	<br />

	<li>New Features:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Try to group online artists with local artists by ignoring slightly different spelling (eg. "The Beatles" vs. "Beatles", "Amy Macdonald" vs. "Amy MacDonald").</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/510">#510</a> - Add (optional) "balanced" track shuffling method, which is less random, but hopefully more pleasing to the listener.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/537">#537</a> - Add audio option to combine channels to build a mono signal (whether player is synchronized or not).</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/538">#538</a> - Add Balance setting for players which support it (thanks philippe44!).</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/621">#621</a> - Add Search feature to the Podcasts plugin (thanks philippe44!).</li>

	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Server Changes:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>When an online scan doesn't return any track, but previously had some, do not remove tracks from library. The empty new list is likely due to a scan failure.</li>
		<li>Try to improve backwards compatibility with eg. Erland's plugins, which sometimes struggle with the remote tracks.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/411">#411</a> - Transcoder conversion rules: Support resampling for Ogg/Flac streams (thanks bpa/mw9!)</li>

		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/526">#526</a> - Add Perl 5.32 and 5.30 support for Linux aarch64 platform. (thanks clivem!)</li>
		<li>Remove Font::FreeType from Linux distributions. It's easy enough to install it using the system's package manager, and it would conflict on system where we don't provide the binary.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Bug Fixes:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/554">#554</a> - Long current playlist disappears from UI during wipe and rescan.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/601">#601</a> - "icon" for URL="file://..." entries does not work in favorites.ompl.</li>

		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/612">#612</a> -  Ask PH if _currentHandler shall be rewritten (HTTP->HTTPS upgrade).</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Other:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/528">#528</a> - On Unix-like platforms, we now ensure that plugins are installed in such a way that none of their files are writable by users other than the user running LMS, even if theyʼre stored that way in the plugin ZIP file.</li>
		<li>No longer include the firmware images for ip3k based players (Classic, Boom, Receiver, Transporter) with the installation packages. Logitech Media Server can download them when needed. But after about a decade without updates it's unlikely anybody would still have to update anyway.</li>
