<h2><a name="v8.0.0" id="v8.0.0"></a>Version 8.0.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="Changelog7.html#v7.9.3">Upstream fixes from Logitech Media Server 7.9.3</a></li>
	<br />

	<li>New Features:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Online music library integration: list your collection of albums vetted in your favorite streaming service as part of your "My Music" collection.</li>
		<li>Improved support for Audio Books: automatically create library views and browse modes dealing with Audio Books and Authors.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Server Changes:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/305">PR #305</a> - use ORIGINALYEAR in FLAC files to override YEAR (thanks jcbodnar!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/267">PR #267</a> - HTTPS certificates are now validated when LMS acts as a client.  HTTPS connections to plugin repositories are no-longer retried over HTTP when they fail.  The old insecure behaviour can optionally be re-enabled, although, instead, we recommend working out why HTTPS is broken in your environment and fixing that if possible.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/308">PR #308</a> - Update faad binaries to fix several CVE-2017 security issues (thanks ralphy!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/346">PR #346</a> - Update Audio::Scan on Windows to 1.02 (thanks ralphy!)</li>
		<li>Read Conductor tag from m4a etc. files.</li>
		<li>Persist some web browser side preferences like artwork mode, expanded menus etc. on the server. Safari would regularly "forget" them.</li>
		<li>Improve cache purging to reduce startup time and the risk of locking up other initialization tasks.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Bug Fixes:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/313">#313</a> - Advanced Search for albums returns emtpy "Song Info ()" link</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/327">#327</a> - "playlist loadalbum" command is case sensitive and otherwise fragile.</li>
		<li>Always strip BOM from M3U files, not only if the first line is a comment.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
</ul>
