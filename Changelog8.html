<h2><a name="v8.2.0" id="v8.2.0"></a>Version 8.2.0 - 2021-08-03 (1ec16032b)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="Changelog8.html#v8.1.2">Upstream fixes from Logitech Media Server 8.1.x</a></li>
	<br />

	<li>New Features:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Try to group online artists with local artists by ignoring slightly different spelling (eg. "The Beatles" vs. "Beatles", "Amy Macdonald" vs. "Amy MacDonald").</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/510">#510</a> - Add (optional) "balanced" track shuffling method, which is less random, but hopefully more pleasing to the listener.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/537">#537</a> - Add audio option to combine channels to build a mono signal (whether player is synchronized or not).</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/538">#538</a> - Add Balance setting for players which support it (thanks philippe44!).</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/621">#621</a> - Add Search feature to the Podcasts plugin (thanks philippe44!).</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/630">#630</a> - Add parsing of remote OPML list.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/627">#627</a> - Allow explodePlaylist to return an OPML list, not just an array or urls.</li>
		<li>Enable basic track statistics (play count, last played, ratings) for online tracks imported into the library.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/581">#581</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/591">#591</a> - Create new player protocol to buffer http streams to disk or re-establish dropped connections to improve reliability (thanks philippe44!).</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Server Changes:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>When an online scan doesn't return any track, but previously had some, do not remove tracks from library. The empty new list is likely due to a scan failure.</li>
		<li>Try to improve backwards compatibility with eg. Erland's plugins, which sometimes struggle with the remote tracks.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/411">#411</a> - Transcoder conversion rules: Support resampling for Ogg/Flac streams (thanks bpa/mw9!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/598">#598</a> - Shuffle tracks added with "playlist loadtracks" and certain search filters (thanks philchillbill!)</li>
		<li>Added hook for 3rd party plugins to tell DSTM not to kick in.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Platform Support:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver-platforms/pull/18">#18</a> - Add a systemd service file for Debian based systems (thanks mw9 & tomscytale).</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver-platforms/pull/22">#22</a> - Add systemd service configuration for RPM based systems (thanks JohanSaaw!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver-platforms/pull/25">#25</a> - Add weak dependency on perl IO::Socket:SSL in RPM (thanks JohanSaaw!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/526">#526</a> - Add Perl 5.32 and 5.30 support for Linux aarch64 platform. (thanks clivem!)</li>
		<li>Remove Font::FreeType from Linux distributions. It's easy enough to install it using the system's package manager, and it would conflict on system where we don't provide the binary.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Bug Fixes:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/554">#554</a> - Long current playlist disappears from UI during wipe and rescan.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/601">#601</a> - "icon" for URL="file://..." entries does not work in favorites.ompl.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/629">#629</a> -  Set SO_KEEPALIVE for cli socket so they auto-close when peer disappears.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/632">#632</a> -  Keep shall in foreground when startTime is required and bitrate is missing.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/617">#617</a> -  Handle volatile redirected url, retry from original one if failed after resume.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/612">#612</a> -  Ask PH if _currentHandler shall be rewritten (HTTP->HTTPS upgrade).</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<li>Other:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/issues/528">#528</a> - On Unix-like platforms, we now ensure that plugins are installed in such a way that none of their files are writable by users other than the user running LMS, even if theyʼre stored that way in the plugin ZIP file.</li>
		<li>No longer include the firmware images for ip3k based players (Classic, Boom, Receiver, Transporter) with the installation packages. Logitech Media Server can download them when needed. But after about a decade without updates it's unlikely anybody would still have to update anyway.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
</ul>

		<li>Make sure we get the mysqueezebox.com based app menu even for players which are not registered there.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/508">#508</a> - Don't include the port when using default ports in host header for http requests.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/521">#521</a> - Fix http redirection on HTTPS protocol handlers (thanks philippe44!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/523">#523</a> - Fix http redirection when redirect URL is missing the protocol (thanks philippe44!)</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/531">#531</a> - Player's library view setting and Random Mix preference conflict with each other.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/536">#536</a> - When an album list is filtered by contributor role, the contributor's name sometimes isn't shown with the album.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/pull/545">#545</a> - Under certain circumstances 3rd party plugins could be hidden on non-Squeezeplay based players.</li>
