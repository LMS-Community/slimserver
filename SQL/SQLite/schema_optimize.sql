-- Recreate the contributor_album table to ensure it is accurate (bug 4882).
-- This is done here as it is faster to do in sql than in the server.

-- XXX This appears to not be needed anymore as contributors are properly
-- removed by the new scanner

--DELETE FROM contributor_album;

--INSERT INTO contributor_album (role,contributor,album) SELECT DISTINCT role,contributor,album FROM contributor_track,tracks where tracks.id=contributor_track.track;

DELETE FROM scanned_files;

-- Analyze is slow but very necessary for SQLite to choose correct indices for queries, especially
