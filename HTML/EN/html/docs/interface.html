<p>
Your display uses a system of menus that are navigated using the gray LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN buttons on the remote control. There are four ways to locate songs in your music library:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Browse music exactly as it is organized on your server computer-s hard disk (Music Library)
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-family:Symbol"><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span>Browse index trees built from the music files- ID3 information (Genres, Artists, and Albums)
</li>
<li>
Browse through the playlists that you have saved using the web interface
</li>
<li>
Search for songs, artists, or albums
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Songs, playlists, and directories can be located and added to the current playlist with the remote control.
</p>
<h4><a></a><a>Home</a></h4> 
<p>
The player main menu is the starting point for browsing music, searching, and editing the current playlist. You can get back to Home by pressing the gray LEFT button on the remote control.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the Home menu  on a Squeezebox, what you see on your player model may vary:
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Squeezebox Home
Browse Albums                         -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
The top line of the display shows your current location. The bottom line shows the item currently selected. In the example above, you could press the gray RIGHT button to browse the albums available for playing.
</p>
<p>
Repeatedly pressing the gray UP or DOWN buttons cycles through the other available choices:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Now Playing
</li>
<li>
Browse Genres
</li>
<li>
Browse Albums
</li>
<li>
Browse Artists
</li>
<li>
Browse Music Library [except Mac OS X when using iTunes]
</li>
<li>
Search Artists
</li>
<li>
Search Albums
</li>
<li>
Search Songs
</li>
<li>
Settings
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a></a><a>Browsing Music<a></h4> 
<p>
You can browse your music collection directly from the player by using the Slim&nbsp;Devices remote control. In this section we-ll use browsing the Music Library as an example-but browsing Genres, Albums, or Artists works the same way.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> The Browse Music Library menu choice is not available if you are using a Mac OS X computer as your server, and the server software is accessing your iTunes folder as its source of music files. From the player Home menu, press the gray UP or DOWN button on the remote control until you see:</span>
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Squeezebox Home
Browse Music Folder                   -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Press the gray RIGHT button to enter the Music Library. The player displays a list of the items at the top level of the hard disk hierarchy:
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Music Folder (6 of 10)
Punk                                  -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
The above example shows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The player is at the top level of the Music Library.
</li>
<li>
There are ten items in this library.
</li>
<li>
The item currently selected is &Ograve;Punk.&Oacute;
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notice the arrow in the bottom right corner of the display - it indicates that you can use the gray RIGHT button on the remote control, and therefore this is a directory that you can enter.
</p>
<p>
Pressing the gray DOWN button scrolls to the next item in the folder:
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Music Folder (7 of 10)
Rock                                  -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
If you want to open this folder ("Rock") press the gray RIGHT button on the remote control:
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Rock (16 of 33)
Led Zeppelin                          -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>


<p>
In the Rock folder there are 33 subfolders. At this point, you can either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Press the gray RIGHT button to choose &Ograve;Led Zeppelin.&Oacute;
</li>
<li>
Press the gray UP or DOWN buttons to scroll through the artists.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> If you want to scroll quickly, you can hold down the button.</span>
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Rock/Led Zeppelin (1 of 6)
Early Days &amp; Latter Days              -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
In this example, the player is displaying a selection that is two folders deep, so it displays "Rock/Led Zeppelin". You can press the gray UP or DOWN buttons on the remote control to scroll through the Led Zeppelin albums:
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Rock/Led Zeppelin (2 of 6)
Houses Of The Holy                    -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Press the gray RIGHT button to select the Led Zeppelin album, <i>Houses of the Holy.</i>
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Led Zeppelin/Houses Of The Holy (6 of 8)
06 D'yer Mak'er                        *
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
In this example, the player automatically goes to track 6 on the album. The player remembers the selection you were listening to the last time you played this album, and opens the album on that selection.
</p>
<p>
Notice that instead of an arrow in the lower-right corner of the player display (indicating that there are more choices available if you press the gray RIGHT button), there is a music note symbol (indicating that an album track is displayed).
</p>
<p>
On the remote control, press the gray UP button a few times to choose track 3:
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Led Zeppelin/Houses Of The Holy (6 of 8)
03 Over The Hills And Far              *
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Now press the light blue PLAY button. The track plays. Even as a track is playing, you can browse in other folders.
</p>
<h4><a></a><a>Adding files and directories to the current playlist</a></h4> 
<p>
The player maintains a current playlist at all times. You can add individual tracks, entire albums, even large folders of music files to the playlist.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to add an item to the playlist:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On the remote control, you can press the light blue PLAY button. This clears out the current queue and plays only the selected item(s)
</li>
<li>
You can press the gray ADD button to append the selected item(s) to the current playlist.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Example:</b>To create a playlist of all the songs by Sublime
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Start at the Home menu.
</li>
<li>
Scroll down to &quot;Artists.&quot;
</li>

Abba                                  -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Press the gray DOWN button until you get to "Sublime":
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Artists (611 of 622)
Sublime                               -&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Press the gray RIGHT button on the remote control to browse albums and tracks by Sublime, or
</p>
<p>
Press the light blue PLAY button to create a playlist of all the Sublime tracks.
</p>
<p>
To append all of the Sublime tracks to the current queue, press the gray ADD button. The player briefly displays:
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Adding to the end of playlist:
Sublime                                 
</pre></td></tr></table>

</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
This example shows that there are 125 items currently in the playlist, and the one playing at the moment is the eighth one, <i>Rivers of Babylon.</i><span style='font-style:normal'> Pressing the gray UP and DOWN buttons scrolls through the items in the list, while pressing the gray ADD button removes an item.</span>

Keep pressing the remote control gray UP or DOWN buttons repeatedly until you see the artist name again, indicating that you have seen all available information for that track.
</p>
<h4><a></a><a>Searching</a></h4> 
<p>
The player provides an advanced search mechanism to help you locate songs in large collections. You can search by song title, artist, or album.
</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Press the gray UP or DOWN buttons to select:
</li>
<ul>
<li>

A-&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
You can enter the text (or numbers) you are looking for in either of two ways:
</p>
<p>
Method 1: Use the gray LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN buttons to enter letters or numbers.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Press the gray UP or DOWN buttons until the character you want is displayed.
</li>
<li>
Press the gray RIGHT button once to advance one space to the right.
</li>
<li>
Fix errors by pressing the gray LEFT button.
</li>
<li>
After you've entered all of the text you want to use for the search, press the gray RIGHT button twice to execute the search.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Method 2: For each character position, press the black number buttons one, two, or three times until the desired letter or number appears. Use this method:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Press the black number buttons (2 &#150; 9) one, two, or three times for letters and numbers
</li>
<li>
Press the 0 (zero) button for a space
</li>
<li>
Press the 1 button repeatedly for punctuation.
</li>
<li>
Press the gray LEFT button to erase (the cursor position adjusts for you). Press and hold to erase more than one character.
</li>
<li>
Press the gray RIGHT button when you are finished entering text and wish to execute the search
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The cursor automatically advances to the right three seconds after you press a button. If the button you want next is different from the last button you pressed, you can proceed as quickly as you wish. If you need to press the same button consecutively, wait for the cursor to advance before pressing the button again or press the RIGHT arrow button to move on.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> You don't necessarily need to enter the entire album name, artist name, or song title to successfully search successfully. For example, this search:</span>
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Search for song titles containing:
ZUT-&gt;                                   
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
can yield what you are looking for:
</p>

<table><tr><td><pre class="screenshot">
Song titles matching "ZUT" (1 of 23)
01 Zut Alors!                          *
</pre></td></tr></table>


From here, you can browse and select songs just as if you were in a directory.
