  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>
    The Player IR interface to the Squeezebox associates human actions
    (pressing a button on the remote) with functions on the server (jumping to
    the next song). There are a number of translations, or mappings between the
    human action and the server function.
  </p>
  <p>
    The remote translates the particular button pressed into a series of pulses
    of infrared light. The player recieves these pulses, and translates them
    into a four byte code, which is sent to the server. The server looks up
    this code in a table and tranlates it into a button name. The button name
    is then looked up in another table to produce the function which should be
    called.
  </p>
  <p>
    The button to IR pulse mapping depends on the remote used, and is not generally
    customizable, although programmable remotes can be used. The IR pulse to code
    mapping is controlled in the firmware of the player, and cannot be modified
    without updating that firmware. The code to button name mapping is controlled
    through <em>.ir</em> files, typically one for each type of remote used to control
    the player. The final button name to function mapping is controlled through
    <em>.map</em> files, consisting of a default mapping file, and any custom maps
    which may have been created.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mapping files, both <em>.ir</em> and <em>.map</em>, are stored in the
    <strong>IR</strong> subfolder of the folder where the Squeezebox software was
    installed. Included with the software are two <em>.ir</em> files:
    <em>jvc_dvd.ir</em> and <em>Slim_Devices_Remote.ir</em> which handle the codesets
    sent by the JVC DVD player (which is the codeset most commonly used by the
    player prior to the production of the product specific remotes) and the
    product specific remote respectively. One <em>.map</em> file(<em>Default.map</em>),
    representing the default mapping is included.
  </p>

  <h4>Mappings</h4>
  <h5>Code to Button Name</h5>
  <p>
    The code to button name mapping is contained within <em>.ir</em> files located
    in the <strong>IR</strong> subfolder of the Lyrion Music Server folder. The files
    consist of lines with the button name followed by an equals sign (<strong>=</strong>)
    followed by the IR code in hex (no 0x necessary). Everything after a <strong>#</strong>
    is considered a comment. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored, as is whitespace
    around the <strong>=</strong> and preceding the <strong>#</strong>. The
    <strong>=</strong> and <strong>#</strong> characters are not allowed within the
    button name, but embedded whitespace (except newlines) is allowed. Due to the
    implementation of button pressing styles (explained below), the period
    (<strong>.</strong>) is not recommended for use within a button name.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple codes can map to the same button name. On the other hand, if
    a particular code is repeated within the same file, only the last mapping
    will actually be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    The server will load all <em>.ir</em> files within the <strong>IR</strong>
    subfolder. Individual mappings can be disabled for a particular player by
    using the <em>disabledirsets</em> client array preference. This is
    configurable from the web interface by following the
    &quot;[% "REMOTE_SETTINGS" | string %]&quot;
    link from the &quot;[% "PLAYER_SETTINGS" | string %]&quot; page. This can be useful if
    you have JVC equipment co-located with the player and want to prevent
    it from reacting to remote signals intended for the other equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples:<br />
    <pre>
play = 0000f732
play = 0000f7d6 #alternate code for play, with a comment
    pause     =      0000f7b2   # extra spacing ignored
play=this = 0000f123 #BAD! = not allowed in button names
B# = 0000f7c6        #BAD! # also not allowed in button names
</pre>
  </p>
  <h5>Button Name to Function</h5>
  <p>
    The button name to function mapping is contained within <em>.map</em> files
    located in the <strong>IR</strong> subfolder of the Lyrion Music Server folder.
    The files consist of lines with the button name followed by an equals sign
    (<strong>=</strong>) followed by the function. Everything after a
    <strong>#</strong> is considered a comment. Leading and trailing whitespace
    is ignored, as is whitespace around the <strong>=</strong> and preceding the
    <strong>#</strong>. The <strong>=</strong> and <strong>#</strong> characters
    are not allowed within either the button name or the function, but embedded
    whitespace (except newlines) is allowed. Due to the implementation of button
    pressing styles (explained below), the period (<strong>.</strong>) is not
    recommended for use within a button name, but would be fine for inclusion
    in a function. Similarly, use of the underscore (<strong>_</strong>) is not
    recommended in naming functions, but is fine for button names.
  </p>
  <p>
    The map file is divided up into a number of sections corresponding to the
    various modes of operation, plus a <strong>&#91;common&#93;</strong> section whose
    mappings apply to all modes. Sections start with the name of the section
    enclosed in square brackets (<strong>&#91;&#93;</strong>). Mode classes,
    prefixed by all caps (eg, INPUT.list) will first match to a section headed
    by <strong>&#91;INPUT.list&#93;</strong> then, if no matches found will take
    functions from an <strong>&#91;input&#93;</strong> section.
  <p>
    Multiple button names can map to the same function. On the other hand, if
    a particular button name (including pressing style) is repeated within the
    same section, only the last mapping in that section will actually be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Button pressing styles are indicated by appending a period (<strong>.</strong>)
    to the end of the button name, followed by the desired style.
  </p>
  <p>
    Functions can be passed a single parameter by appending an underscore
    (<strong>_</strong>) to the end of the function name, followed by the parameter
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples:
    <pre>
&#91;common&#93;
arrow_down = down
arrow_down.repeat = down #alternate pressing style for same function
    rew.single     =     jump_rew     #this function uses a parameter, spacing unimportant
fwd.single = jump_fwd #same function, different parameter
&#91;off&#93;
arrow_down = dead #in a different section now, so ok to redefine button names
</pre>

  <h4>Timing</h4>
  <p>
    When a code is first received by the server, the plain button mapping is
    triggered. Also, a timer is set to go off in IRSINGLETIME seconds (currently
    0.256).
  </p>
  <p>
    If the button on the remote is held down, the server will receive additional
    codes identical to the initial one. If the repeated codes are each received
    within IRMINTIME seconds (currently 0.128) of each other, the button.repeat
    mapping is triggered for each repeated code. If one of those repeated codes
    happens between IRHOLDTIME (currently 0.512) and IRHOLDTIME + IRMINTIME seconds,
    the button.hold mapping is triggered.
  </p>
  <p>
    When either IRSINGLETIME seconds pass or a code comes in more than IRMINTIME
    seconds from the previous code, the pending timer is fired. If the code is
    different from the code which initiated the timer, the mapping for button.single
    (for the first code) is triggered. If the new code is the same as the old one,
    the mapping for button.double is triggered.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the timer fired as a result of the time elapsing, then it must be determined
    if the button is still being held. This is the case if the last code received
    was received within the last IRMINTIME seconds. If the button is no longer being
    held, the mapping for button.single is triggered. Otherwise the timer is
    rescheduled for another IRSINGLETIME seconds, or for however long it takes to
    make the total time be IRHOLDTIME seconds. The same checks apply for the next
    time the timer is fired.
  </p>
  <p>
    After IRHOLDTIME seconds have passed, the timer will no longer trigger the
    button.single or button.double mappings. From that point forward, the mapping
    triggered will be button.hold_release when it is finally determinied that the
    button is no longer being held.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple button pressing styles can be included in the mapping with the use of the
    '*' wildcard. Thus button.* will match all styles.  Specific sytles will override the
    for that style.
