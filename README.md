Logitech Media Server
====

Logitech Media Server (aka. LMS, fka. SlimServer, SqueezeCenter, SqueezeboxServer, SliMP3) is the server software that powers audio players from [Logitech](https://www.logi.com) (formerly known as SlimDevices), including [Squeezebox 3rd Generation, Squeezebox Boom, Squeezebox Receiver, Transporter, Squeezebox2, Squeezebox and SLIMP3](http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/Squeezebox_Family_Overview), and many software emulators like [Squeezelite and SqueezePlay](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lmsclients/files/).

With the help of many plugins, Logitech Media Server can stream not only your local music collection, but content from many music services and internet radio stations to your players.

Logitech Media Server is written in Perl. It runs on pretty much any platform that Perl runs on, including Linux, Mac OSX, Solaris and Windows.

Enjoy the music on your Squeezebox!
