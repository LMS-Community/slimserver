Don't install anything here - it could be wiped during the next update.
Thanks.

The Slim/Plugin folder is for plugins installed with Logitech Media Server only. 
Use the user plugin folder instead. The plugin paths are listed in the 
web UI in Settings/Status or on the player in Settings/Information.
