Slim::Control::Request

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements a generic request mechanism for Logitech Media Server.

The general mechansim is to create a Request object and execute it. There is
an option of specifying a callback function, to be called once the request is
executed. In addition, external code can be notified of command execution (see
NOTIFICATIONS below).

Function "Slim::Control::Request::executeRequest" accepts the usual parameters
of client, command array and callback params, and returns the request object.

my $request = Slim::Control::Request::executeRequest($client, ['stop']);

#####################################################################################################################################################################

=head1 REQUESTS

 Requests are object that embodies all data related to performing an action or
 a query.

=head2 ** client ID **          

   Requests store the client ID, if any, to which it applies
     my $clientid = $request->clientid();   # read
     $request->clientid($client->id());     # set

   Methods are provided for convenience using a client, in particular all 
   executeXXXX calls
     my $client = $request->client();       # read
     $request->client($client);             # set

   Some requests require a client to operate. This is encoded in the
   request for error detection. These calls are unlikely to be useful to 
   users of the class but mentioned here for completeness.
     if ($request->needClient()) { ...      # read
     $request->needClient(1);               # set

=head2 ** type **

   Requests are commands that do something or queries that change nothing but
   mainly return data. They are differentiated mainly for performance reasons,
   for example queries are NOT notified. These calls are unlikely to be useful
   to users of the class but mentioned here for completeness.
     if ($request->query()) {...            # read
     $request->query(1);                    # set

=head2 ** request name **

   For historical reasons, command names are composed of multiple terms, f.e.
   "playlist save" or "info total genres", represented as an array. This
   convention was kept, mainly because of the amount of code relying on it.
   The request name is therefore represented as an array, that you can access
   using the getRequest method
     $request->getRequest(0);               # read the first term f.e. "playlist"
     $request->getRequest(1);               # read 2nd term, f.e. "save"
     my $cnt = $request->getRequestCount(); # number of terms
     my $str = $request->getRequestString();# string of all terms, f.e. "playlist save"

   Normally, creating the request is performed through the execute calls or by
   calling new with an array that is parsed by the code here to match the
   available commands and automatically assign parameters. The following
   method is unlikely to be useful to users of this class, but is mentioned
   for completeness.
     $request->addRequest($term);           # add a term to the request

=head2 ** parameters **

   The parsing performed on the array names all parameters, positional or
   tagged. Positional parameters are assigned a name from the addDispatch table,
   and any extra parameters are added as "_pX", where X is the position in the
   array. Tagged parameters are named by their tags, obviously.
   As a consequence, users of the class only access parameter by name
     $request->getParam('_index');          # get the '_index' param
     $request->getParam('_p4');             # get the '_p4' param (auto named)
     $request->getParam('cmd');             # get a tagged param

   Here again, routines used to add parameters are normally not used
   by users of this class, but for completeness
     $request->addParamPos($value);         # adds positional parameter
     $request->addParam($key, $value);      # adds named parameter

=head2 ** results **

   Queries, but some commands as well, do add results to a request. Results
   are either single data points (f.e. how many elements where inserted) or 
   loops (i.e. data for song 1, data being a list of single data point, data for
   song 2, etc).
   Results are named like parameters. Obviously results are only available 
   once the request has been executed (without errors)
     my $data = $request->getResult('_value');
                                            # get a result

   There can be multiple loops in the results. Each loop is named and starts
   with a '@'.
     my $looped = $request->getResultLoop('@songs', 0, '_value');
                                            # get first '_value' result in
                                            # loop '@songs'


=head1 NOTIFICATIONS

 The Request mechanism can notify "subscriber" functions of successful
 command request execution (not of queries). Callback functions have a single
 parameter corresponding to the request object.
 Optionally, the subscribe routine accepts a filter, which limits calls to the
 subscriber callback to those requests matching the filter. The filter is
 in the form of an array ref containing arrays refs (one per dispatch level) 
 containing lists of desirable commands (easier to code than explain, see
 examples below).
 Note that notifications are performed asynchronously from the corresponding
 requests. Notifications are queued and performed when time allows.

=head2 Example

 Slim::Control::Request::subscribe( \&myCallbackFunction, 
                                     [['playlist']]);
 -> myCallbackFunction will be called for any command starting with 'playlist'
 in the table below ('playlist save', playlist loadtracks', etc).

 Slim::Control::Request::subscribe( \&myCallbackFunction, 
				                      [['playlist'], ['save', 'clear']]);
 -> myCallbackFunction will be called for commands "playlist save" and
 "playlist clear", but not for "playlist loadtracks".

 In both cases, myCallbackFunction must be defined as:
 sub myCallbackFunction {
      my $request = shift;

      # do something useful here
      # use the methods of $request to find all information on the
      # request.

      my $client = $request->client();

      my $cmd = $request->getRequestString();

      main::INFOLOG && $log->info("myCallbackFunction called for cmd $cmd\n");
 }


=head1 WRITING COMMANDS & QUERIES, PLUGINS

=head2 This sections provides a rough guide to writing commands and queries.

 Plugins are welcomed to add their own commands to the dispatch table. The
 commands or queries are therefore automatically available in the CLI. Plugin
 authors shall document their commands and queries as they see fit. Plugins
 delivered with the server are documented in the cli API document.

=head2 Adding a command

 To add a command to the dispatch table, use the addDispatch method. If the
 method is part of the server itself, please add it to the init method below
 and update the comment table at the top of the document. 
 In a plugin, call the method from your initPlugin subroutine.

  Slim::Control::Request::addDispatch([<TERMS>], [<DEFINITION>]);

 <TERMS> is a list of the name of the command or query AND positional 
 parameters. (Strictly speaking, the function expects 2 array references).
 The name of the request can be one or more words, like "playlist clear" or
 "info total genres ?". They have to be array elements, so look like:

      addDispatch(['info', 'total', 'genres', '?'], ...

 The request mechanism uses the first array to match requests to definitions.
 There are 3 possibilities: '?' matches itself, but is not added as a param
 (the idea is that the result replaces it). Anything starting with '_' is a 
 parameter: something can be provided to give it a value: it is added to the 
 request as a named parameter. Anything else much match itself and is 
 considered part of the request.
 Order matter we well: first request name, then named parameters, then ?.
 
       addDispatch(['playlist', 'artist', '_index', '?'], ...

   -> ['playlist', 'artist', 'whatever', '?'] OK
   -> ['playlist', 'artist', '33',       '?'] OK
   -> ['playlist', 'artist', '?']             NOK (missing param)
   -> ['playlist', 'artist', '33']            NOK (missing ?)


 The second array <DEFINITION> contains information about the request:
  array[0]: flag indicating if the request requires a client. If enabled,
            the request will not proceed if the client is invalid or undef.
  array[1]: flag indicating if the request is a query. If enabled, the request
            is not notified.
  array[2]: flag indicating if the request has tagged parameters (in the form
            'tag:value'. If enabled the request will look for them while
            parsing the input.
  array[3]: function reference. Please refer to Commands.pm and Queries.pm for
            examples.

 For updates or new server commands, the table format below is the preferred
 choice. In a plugin, the following form may be used:

        |requires Client
        |  |is a Query
        |  |  |has Tags
        |  |  |  |Function to call
        C  Q  T  F

   Slim::Control::Request::addDispatch(['can'], 
       [0, 1, 0, \&canQuery]);

=head2 Grabbing a command

 Some plugins may require to replace or otherwise complete a built in command of
 the server (or a command added by another plugin that happened to load before).
 
 The addDispatch call will return the function pointer of any existing 
 command it replaces. There is no check on the <DEFINITION> array.
 
 So for example, a plugin could replace the "volume" command with the 
 following code example:
 
   my $original_func = addDispatch(['mixer', 'volume', '_newvalue'],
       [1, 0, 0, \&new_mixerVolumeCommand]);
   
 Please perform all relevant checks in the new function and check the 
 original code for any twists to take into account, like synced players.
 Your code should either end up calling $request->setStatusDone OR call the
 original function, maybe after some parameter doctoring.
 
 The function dynamicAutoQuery() in Queries.pm is a good example of this 
 technique.

=head2 new ( clientid, requestLineRef, paramsRef, useIxHashes )

Creates a new Request object. All parameters are optional. clientid is the
client ID the request applies to. requestLineRef is a reference to an array
containing the request terms (f.e. ['pause']). paramsRef is a reference to
a hash containing the request parameters (tags in CLI lingo, f.e. {sort=>albums}).

requestLinRef is parsed to match an entry in the dispatch table, and parameters
found there are added to the params. It best to use requestLineRef for all items
defined in the dispatch table and paramsRef only for tags.

useIxHashes indicates that the response is expected to serialised on the cli and
so order of params and results should be maintained using IxHashes.
