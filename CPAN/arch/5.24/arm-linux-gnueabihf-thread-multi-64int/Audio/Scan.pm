=head1 NAME

Audio::Scan - Fast C metadata and tag reader for all common audio file formats

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Audio::Scan;

    my $data = Audio::Scan->scan('/path/to/file.mp3');

    # Just file info
    my $info = Audio::Scan->scan_info('/path/to/file.mp3');

    # Just tags
    my $tags = Audio::Scan->scan_tags('/path/to/file.mp3');

    # Scan without reading (possibly large) artwork into memory.
    # Instead of binary artwork data, the size of the artwork will be returned instead.
    {
        local $ENV{AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK} = 1;
        my $data = Audio::Scan->scan('/path/to/file.mp3');
    }

    # Scan a filehandle
    open my $fh, '<', 'my.mp3';
    my $data = Audio::Scan->scan_fh( mp3 => $fh );
    close $fh;

    # Scan and compute an audio MD5 checksum
    my $data = Audio::Scan->scan( '/path/to/file.mp3', { md5_size => 100 * 1024 } );
    my $md5 = $data->{info}->{audio_md5};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Audio::Scan is a C-based scanner for audio file metadata and tag information. It currently
supports MP3, MP4, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, ASF, WAV, AIFF, Musepack, Monkey's Audio, and WavPack.

See below for specific details about each file format.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 scan( $path, [ \%OPTIONS ] )

Scans $path for both metadata and tag information.  The type of scan performed is
determined by the file's extension.  Supported extensions are:

    MP3:  mp3, mp2
    MP4:  mp4, m4a, m4b, m4p, m4v, m4r, k3g, skm, 3gp, 3g2, mov
    AAC (ADTS): aac
    Ogg:  ogg, oga
    FLAC: flc, flac, fla
    ASF:  wma, wmv, asf
    Musepack:  mpc, mpp, mp+
    Monkey's Audio:  ape, apl
    WAV: wav
    AIFF: aiff, aif
    WavPack: wv

This method returns a hashref containing two other hashrefs: info and tags.  The
contents of the info and tag hashes vary depending on file format, see below for details.

An optional hashref may be provided with the following values:

    md5_size => $audio_bytes_to_checksum

An MD5 will be computed of the first N audio bytes. Any tags in the file are automatically
skipped, so this is a useful way of determining if a file's audio content is the same even
if tags may have been changed.  The hex MD5 value is returned in the $info->{audio_md5}
key.  This option will reduce performance, so choose a small enough size that works for you,
you should probably avoid using more than 64K for example.

For FLAC files that already contain an MD5 checksum, this value will be used instead
of calculating a new one.

    md5_offset => $offset

Begin computing the audio_md5 value starting at $offset.  If this value is not specified,
$offset defaults to a point in the middle of the file.

=head2 scan_info( $path, [ \%OPTIONS ] )

If you only need file metadata and don't care about tags, you can use this method.

=head2 scan_tags( $path, [ \%OPTIONS ] )

If you only need the tags and don't care about the metadata, use this method.

=head2 scan_fh( $type => $fh, [ \%OPTIONS ] )

Scans a filehandle. $type is the type of file to scan as, i.e. "mp3" or "ogg".
Note that FLAC does not support reading from a filehandle.

=head2 find_frame( $path, $timestamp_in_ms )

Returns the byte offset to the first audio frame starting from the given timestamp
(in milliseconds).

=over 4

=item MP3, Ogg, FLAC, ASF, MP4

The byte offset to the data packet containing this timestamp will be returned. For
file formats that don't provide timestamp information such as MP3, the best estimate for
the location of the timestamp will be returned.  This will be more accurate if the
file has a Xing header or is CBR for example.

=item WAV, AIFF, Musepack, Monkey's Audio, WavPack

Not yet supported by find_frame.

=back

=head2 find_frame_return_info( $mp4_path, $timestamp_in_ms )

The header of an MP4 file contains various metadata that refers to the structure of
the audio data, making seeking more difficult to perform. This method will return
the usual $info hash with 2 additional keys:

    seek_offset - The seek offset in bytes
    seek_header - A rewritten MP4 header that can be prepended to the audio data
                  found at seek_offset to construct a valid bitstream. Specifically,
                  the following boxes are rewritten: stts, stsc, stsz, stco

For example, to seek 30 seconds into a file and write out a new MP4 file seeked to
this point:

    my $info = Audio::Scan->find_frame_return_info( $file, 30000 );

    open my $f, '<', $file;
    sysseek $f, $info->{seek_offset}, 1;

    open my $fh, '>', 'seeked.m4a';
    print $fh $info->{seek_header};

    while ( sysread( $f, my $buf, 65536 ) ) {
        print $fh $buf;
    }

    close $f;
    close $fh;

=head2 find_frame_fh( $type => $fh, $offset )

Same as C<find_frame>, but with a filehandle.

=head2 find_frame_fh_return_info( $type => $fh, $offset )

Same as C<find_frame_return_info>, but with a filehandle.

=head2 has_flac()

Deprecated.  Always returns 1 now that FLAC is always enabled.

=head2 is_supported( $path )

Returns 1 if the given path can be scanned by Audio::Scan, or 0 if not.

=head2 get_types()

Returns an array of strings of the file types supported by Audio::Scan.

=head2 extensions_for( $type )

Returns an array of strings of the file extensions that are considered to
be the file type I<$type>.

=head2 type_for( $extension )

Returns file type for a given extension. Returns I<undef> for unsupported
extensions.

=head1 SKIPPING ARTWORK

To save memory while reading tags, you can opt to skip potentially large
embedded artwork.  To do this, set the environment variable AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK:

    local $ENV{AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK} = 1;
    my $tags = Audio::Scan->scan_tags($file);

This will return the length of the embedded artwork instead of the actual image data.
In some cases it will also return a byte offset to the image data, which can be used
to extract the image using more efficient means.  Note that the offset is not always
returned so if you want to use this data make sure to check for offset.  If offset
is not present, the only way to get the image data is to perform a normal tag scan
without the environment variable set.

One limitation that currently exists is that memory for embedded images is still
allocated for ASF and Ogg Vorbis files.

This information is returned in different ways depending on the format:

ID3 (MP3, AAC, WAV, AIFF):

    $tags->{APIC}->[3]: image length
    $tags->{APIC}->[4]: image offset (unless APIC would need unsynchronization)

MP4:

    $tags->{COVR}: image length
    $tags->{COVR_offset}: image offset (always available)

Ogg Vorbis:

    $tags->{ALLPICTURES}->[0]->{image_data}: image length
    Image offset is not supported with Vorbis because the data is always base64-encoded.

FLAC:

    $tags->{ALLPICTURES}->[0]->{image_data}: image length
    $tags->{ALLPICTURES}->[0]->{offset}: image offset (always available)

ASF:

    $tags->{'WM/Picture'}->{image}: image length
    $tags->{'WM/Picture'}->{offset}: image offset (always available)

APE, Musepack, WavPack, MP3 with APEv2:

    $tags->{'COVER ART (FRONT)'}: image length
    $tags->{'COVER ART (FRONT)_offset'}: image offset (always available)

=head1 THANKS

Logitech & Slim Devices, for letting us release so much of our code to the world.
Long live Squeezebox!

Kimmo Taskinen, Adrian Smith, Clive Messer, and Jurgen Kramer for
DSF/DSDIFF support and various other fixes.

Some code from the Rockbox project was very helpful in implementing ASF and
MP4 seeking.

Some of the file format parsing code was derived from the mt-daapd project,
and adapted by Netgear.  It has been heavily rewritten to fix bugs and add
more features.

The source to the original Netgear C scanner for SqueezeCenter is located
at L<http://svn.slimdevices.com/repos/slim/7.3/trunk/platforms/readynas/contrib/scanner>

The audio MD5 feature uses an MD5 implementation by L. Peter Deutsch,
E<lt>ghost@aladdin.comE<gt>.
